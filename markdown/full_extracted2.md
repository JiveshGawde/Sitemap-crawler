[ A family history ](file://cleaned_page.html/<https:/www.tacchini.it/en/story/a-family-history/>)
The Tacchini building features an architecture structured into two storeys, a fusion of materials and spaces that blend into a complete whole, expressing its ethos and essence. Each object, each piece of furniture created in this building carries within it the hallmark of Italian design. 
[ Designers ](file://cleaned_page.html/<https:/www.tacchini.it/en/designers/>)
Like snapshots of real life, there are key players who make the stories they tell unique: in the house of Tacchini, designers are honoured guests who dress its secret rooms. Great masters who narrate their stories to their disciples, like parents who enable their children to dream before they even fall asleep: all gathered around a hearth that burns with passion and creativity. Designs become places to be explored and missions to be accomplished, moments to be experienced, and remembered forever.

[ Handmade in Italy ](file://cleaned_page.html/<https:/www.tacchini.it/en/quality/handmade-in-italy/>)
At Tacchini, hands were the first tool they learnt to harness, and they continue to use them to discern the quality and value of the materials, before transforming them, sewing them and combining them together: following ancient, knowing rhythms, retracing and honing history and memory. 
[ Tacchini for quality ](file://cleaned_page.html/<https:/www.tacchini.it/en/quality/tacchini-for-quality/>)
Attention to quality begins with the choice of materials, which in themselves can convey strong sensations, and are further enhanced by the regard for detail and by technological innovations, which are noticeable in every piece and every space designed by Tacchini. 
[ Materials Library ](file://cleaned_page.html/<https:/www.tacchini.it/en/materials/>)
The Tacchini collection and designs are about more than just production and processes. The history of this family, and of the company that bears its name, is interwoven with the history of Italian and international design: each chapter was written with care and attention to detail, and each product reflects this passion. 
[ Corporate certifications ](file://cleaned_page.html/<https:/www.tacchini.it/en/certifications/corporate-certifications/>)

Architectural shapes inspired this collection of low tables with futuristic lines by Dutch design studio Truly Truly. Made of bent and welded sheets of metal, the Daze low tables are hand colored, one by one, so that the intensity of the paint changes as it spills out of the cuts with different effects. Artisan craftsmanship with the aid of high tech, adds a note of unpredictability to the precise geometrics of the shapes and materials. The most important feature of this tables is that the second painting, the “shade” is done by hand, so each time you will have a different result of intensity and direction of the paint.

#  Truly Truly 
Truly Truly is a Rotterdam (NL) based design studio. It was founded by Australian husband and wife design team Joel Booy & Kate Booy, and operates on the interface between industry and art. They run a versatile practice, creating textiles, lighting, furniture and spatial installations. How a design will be experienced is crucial to the core of their work. Truly Truly is a manifesto: make things properly, honestly and artfully. “We are constantly trying to appeal to our own desire to be surprised, captivated or moved. Our work is often sculptural or poetic, with tactility, sensuality and functionality playing an important role.”
