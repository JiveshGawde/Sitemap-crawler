    "[Designers](https://www.tacchini.it/en/designers/)": "Like snapshots of real life, there are key players who make the stories they tell unique: in the house of Tacchini, designers are honoured guests who dress its secret rooms. Great masters who narrate their stories to their disciples, like parents who enable their children to dream before they even fall asleep: all gathered around a hearth that burns with passion and creativity. Designs become places to be explored and missions to be accomplished, moments to be experienced, and remembered forever.

[Tacchini for quality](https://www.tacchini.it/en/quality/tacchini-for-quality/) Attention to quality begins with the choice of materials, which in themselves can convey strong sensations, and are further enhanced by the regard for detail and by technological innovations, which are noticeable in every piece and every space designed by Tacchini.",

    "Architectural shapes inspired this collection of low tables with futuristic lines by Dutch design studio Truly Truly. Made of bent and welded sheets of metal, the Daze low tables are hand colored, one by one, so that the intensity of the paint changes as it spills out of the cuts with different effects. Artisan craftsmanship with the aid of high tech, adds a note of unpredictability to the precise geometrics of the shapes and materials. The most important feature of this tables is that the second painting, the “shade” is done by hand, so each time you will have a different result of intensity and direction of the paint.": "[2D and 3D files request](https://www.tacchini.it/en/richiedi-file-2d-e-3d/)",

It was founded by Australian husband and wife design team Joel Booy & Kate Booy, and operates on the interface between industry and art. They run a versatile practice, creating textiles, lighting, furniture and spatial installations. How a design will be experienced is crucial to the core of their work. Truly Truly is a manifesto: make things properly, honestly and artfully. “We are constantly trying to appeal to our own desire to be surprised, captivated or moved. Our work is often sculptural or poetic, with tactility, sensuality and functionality playing an important role.” Products",
